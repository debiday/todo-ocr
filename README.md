## Setup and Running

1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install Tesseract OCR. On Ubuntu, you can do this with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
    ```

    On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install tesseract
    ```

    For other operating systems, see the [Tesseract GitHub page](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki) for installation instructions.

3. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <this_repository_url>
    ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

5. It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies. You can do this with the following commands:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

6. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

7. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python app.py  # Replace with your main Python file
    ```

Now, your application should be running at `localhost:5000` (or whatever port you've configured).
